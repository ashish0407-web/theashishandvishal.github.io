						<b>ABOUT TEACHER'S DAY </b>
						<p>The light of the world, the beacon in the dark and the hope that gives us strength to survive, is our teacher. Today we celebrate Teachers' Day. A day, kept aside to honour the gifted souls who work everyday to make sure that the future is bright for all of us. Let us welcome all the teachers with a big round of applause.

On this beautiful occasion, let us take the opportunity to convey our wishes to all our teachers, who have given impeccable contribution in shaping us.</p>

<p> Every year 5th of September, we celebrate Teachers Day. It is a day filled with lots of excitement, joy and happiness as students are eagerly looking forward to tell their teachers how and why are they special to them. It is my honour to to talk about our dear teachers on this wonderful occasion.</p>

<p> We celebrate Teachers' day on 5th of September every year in India. September 5th is marked by the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and the Teachers' day is celebrated in commemoration of his birthday. Along with being a succesful leader in the form of the President of the Country, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was great scholar and an excellent teacher.</p>
